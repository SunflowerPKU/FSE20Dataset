0,61123985,[tracking issue] converting tests to use countdown,"one possible set of tasks that i can suggest for new contributors who are bit more confident in their node.js skills, would be converting tests to use the new `../common/countdown` utility module.

for instance, if you take a look at: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/test/parallel/test-http2-client-destroy.js, you'll see that there is a remaining counter (https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/test/parallel/test-http2-client-destroy.js#l19). the test then counts down remaining before closing the server. there are quite a large number of tests in our suite that perform similar actions in ways that are rather inconsistent. the ../common/countdown utility was designed to bring some consistency there.

the way the countdown utility works is straightforward:


i know that there are quite a few of the http2 tests that can benefit from this, along with a bunch of other http and https tests.

these tasks would be for folks who are a bit more comfortable with their node.js skills.

there are *many* tests in the suite that could be modified to use this new utility. however, rather than modifying them all at once, if a new contributor wishes to take this on, please one change one or two at a time, leaving other tests for other contributors to pick up on. just reference this tracking issue in the commit/pr so that we can keep track.

2,61340960,implement inline sqrt functionality in floattensor with cpu/gpu backend support,"user story: 
as a data scientist using pysyft's floattensor type, i want to leverage a wide range of methods which use our new unity backend. for this ticket to be complete, the sqrt_() should be added to our floattensor class with the appropriate functionality. note that the method runs inline, the method called on a tensor returns the tensor on which it is called.

furthermore, the function should automatically determine which backend to use (cpu/gpu) based on where the data is located. if the data is located on the cpu, a performant cpu implementation should run but if the data for a given floattensor is located on a gpu, it should be run using an hlsl kernel where appropriate. obviously, if no gpu is available, it should automatically fall back to the cpu implementation.

every reference you might need for this issue:

acceptance criteria:

 [ ] an integration test in pysyft demonstrating the correct cpu and gpu operation implemented over a floattensor while connected to a unity backend
 [ ] a unit test in openmined/openmined demonstrating the correct operation on a floattensor
 [ ] link your pull request back to this issue so that it gets closed appropriately when the pr is merged.

10,53934470,yarn local mirror creates invalid file name when git repository is at server root,"do you want to request a *feature* or report a *bug*?
bug

what is the current behavior?

my project's local `.yarnrc` is configured with this setting:


in my `package.json` i have a reference to the following internal package:


notice that git repository is at the root of the server, rather than being a subfolder as with github repositories: `git@github.com:itsananderson/some-repo.git`

unfortunately, with the way yarn parses the git url to generate the cache name, it generates this:

i believe that's due to this code: https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/blob/5e1eee74f18b7f229e8accb49e7ba9ac9c4655bf/src/fetchers/git-fetcher.js#l40

when a url like `git+ssh://git@git.corp.net:private_package.git` is parsed, the `pathname` property is set to `:private_package.git`. one potential fix for this would be to simply trim the colon from the beginning.

if the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.

i tried to create a github demo of this issue, but since the issue only appears for repositories where the git repo name is at the root of the server, the issue can't be reproduced with github repositories.

here are the steps i used to create a minimal repro by creating a local `--bare` git clone and adding it as `git+ssh//$user@localhost:node-extend.git`. i used `node-extend` because it's a simple module with no dependencies that can be installed from its git repository.


note that you may need to authorize your own ssh key to log into your machine. this should work for a typical setup:


hopefully that's enough detail to make the repro easy, but let me know if you need more.

what is the expected behavior?

the cache file should be created without a colon in the name. this is an important bug, because colons aren't valid characters in windows file names.

53,10258893,named chunks ignoring names when requiring modules at runtime,"hey guys, firstly webpack is great.

i am having some trouble with code splitting. i am trying to have 2 named chunks for two routes in my application which are not often visited. mysite.com/settings and mysite.com/access.

here is my webpack.config.coffee


and here is my router.coffee


i am not using the webpack dev-server, instead i am watching simply by using the following cmd-line tool


the problem is that it ignores the names when requiring the files, as you can see the format is '[name]-[chunkhash].js' it generates files with the correct format e.g. settings-2j3nekj2n3ejkn2.js but during development, when i attempt to load the page, the browser complains that '-2j3nekj2n3ejkn2.js' cannot be found, somehow the mapping of the files, ignores the names. if i leave out the names, then it works.

generated files

chrome error

so the question is how can i setup mulitple named chunks correctly (or is there a bug). thanks in advance.

note i have checked out their examples in the docs at https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/code-splitting

and i have followed their optimization docs aswell at https://github.com/webpack/docs/wiki/optimization

80,13527697,consider moving the notifications to bottom of screen,"after using the new notifications, i find they are a great improvement, but still not quite perfect. due to their location, they frequently interfere with my workflow in two ways:
 they hide the actions i am working with, making it hard to access the archive or flag read/unread buttons when i am sorting my mail. sorting my mail is the most frequent trigger for notifications, so this happens literally all the time.
 if i time things badly and try to dismiss a notification (so as to avoid the problem above) just as it has decided to dismiss itself, i end up clicking the logout button.

it seems both problems could be avoided entirely by moving the notifications to the bottom of the screen instead of the top. this would obscure much less critical parts of the ui, often nothing on the search result page and on conversation view it would partially obscure the reply button and not much else unless there were a lot of notifications stacked up.

this code results in a fatal error. the `end()` function exists (is callable), hence the string is not treated as property path. instead, `end()` is called with invalid arguments. imo there are very few cases where this would be the expected behavior, and even if, it could be solved by passing a closure:


treating callable strings as callables should be deprecated. i.e., all methods of propertyaccessdecorator should trigger deprecation errors `if (is_string($value) && is_callable($value))`.

for instance, if you take a look at: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/test/parallel/test-http2-client-destroy.js, you'll see that there is a remaining counter (https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/test/parallel/test-http2-client-destroy.js#l19). the test then counts down remaining before closing the server. there are quite a large number of tests in our suite that perform similar actions in ways that are rather inconsistent. the ../common/countdown utility was designed to bring some consistency there.

the way the countdown utility works is straightforward:


i know that there are quite a few of the http2 tests that can benefit from this, along with a bunch of other http and https tests.

these tasks would be for folks who are a bit more comfortable with their node.js skills.

there are *many* tests in the suite that could be modified to use this new utility. however, rather than modifying them all at once, if a new contributor wishes to take this on, please one change one or two at a time, leaving other tests for other contributors to pick up on. just reference this tracking issue in the commit/pr so that we can keep track.

reasoning is, i had no way of knowing if this was official behavior since it was undocumented, and when it first existed / introduced so i had to test it myself to see across a few node versions. so it would've saved me some time and others time in the future.

if it exists already, my apologies, i tried looking through the http doc but could not find a mention.

173,43856500,forcing gbp-mode via game hack non-functional on mgba.,"first off, i've confirmed this as working on hardware twice over; while the hack is amateurish, it's not the problem.


however, while this patch works on hardware (ds lite and, ironically, game boy player tested) and other emulators (no$gba and vba-m tested), on mgba the patch results in some unexpected behavior.

with the gbp override turned off in mgba, the game fails to run with the gbp palette in spite of the patch, and freezes on the ""mario start!""/""luigi start!"" screen when attempting to start a level. there's no apparent way to get in-game or play anything.

with the gbp override turned on in mgba, everything seems to work just fine (although it defeats the purpose of hacking the rom in the first place).

suppose i have two or more running node processes which are not in debugging mode and i want to activate the debugger in these processes. by using sigusr1 or `process._debugprocess()` the process starts listening on the default port 5858 for the debugging client. all node processes after the first that receive sigusr1 will fail to take port 5858 and thus cannot be debugged while already running.

worse, if you use `node debug -p $pid_of_second_process` the debugger will attach to the first node process that was able to take port 5858 instead of the pid given on the command-line.

is there any way to change the default debugging port for an already running node process, so i can attach to that?

the get method of http and https modules does not check the prototype of the given object. i guess this replicates to all other request/response methods.
the following code is ran on a machine that does not have anything running on port 8989:
and we receive the following output:
this means the port takes the default value and successfully connects instead of taking the 8989 port from the prototype.
is this intended?

the need for this code arose from the necessity to reuse some default options in multiple requests. so i would like to ask a followup question:

can reusing(altering) the options object passed to a http/https request cause unexpected behavior(requests being made to the last value of the object instead of the value at the moment of the function call or performance losses)?

 pan somewhere
 see how the vector layers are cropped by the bounds of the map previous to the panning

247,7576928,look for missing error handling,"in the callback pattern common to node.js you often see code that looks like this:


it would be really great if we could somehow enforce that errors are handled.

in particular this rule _could be_ as simple as, given a function with `err` as an argument, ensure that `err` is used within that function. acceptable uses that would satisfy that criteria would be:
 `if (err) { /* .. */ }`
 `next(err, data)`

the following should not pass the criteria:
 `// if (err) {`
 `function(err, data) { dosomethingwith(data); }`

certainly, relying on the name of the error is really sketchy, but it's difficult without some sort of convention to know when we're expecting an err and when we're just expecting any old data.

there will be much to discuss in how to implement this. here's a thread that kind of started the discussion:

note that if you copy all three messages, it works as desired. 

in the other direction: if you select messages foo and bar, it does copy the recipient bar header, which it should not. 

basically, the current algorithm seems to be: the recipient bar header is copied if: you select more than 1 message, and select the first message in the recipient block.

the correct algorithm is: the recipient bar header is copied if: you select messages from more than 1 recipient block, and select any message in the recipient block.

expected behavior

when restarting collectd (for example, after a configuration change) it is expected that when using write_prometheus as the primary output method the service will be available immediately.

actual behavior

when restarting collectd, the microhttpd used by write_prometheus will fail to start if the previous daemon was running less than two minutes before.  the write_prometheus plugin will log an error, collectd will continue on and not recover on its own.

steps to reproduce

*   step 1

configure collectd with the write_prometheus plugin.  a minimal configuration is fine, and there is no need to actually gather any stats.  the default port, 9103, is sufficient.

*   step 2

start collectd.  confirm that the plugin started successfully by viewing the output of ""curl http://<host>:9103""

*   step 3

shut down the daemon, and then immediately restart it.  no config changes are necessary.  confirm that write_prometheus has failed to start by viewing ""curl http://<host>:9103""... you should receive a connection refused error.

bring cursor back in page area

result: map continues to pan following the cursor until user clicks inside page area.

this should behave as it does in other browsers, specifically, that the map continues to pan around even while the cursor is outside the window until the button is released.  it looks to be something funky with firefox, but google managed to make it work right in maps, so there's at least a demonstrated workaround.

enter single-player jungle jam.
enter _any_ of the events (i've tested them all for this bug, including the ones that are only unlockable by codes).
pause and scroll down (or up) to press ""select event""
you are then teleported to the last world instead of going back to the ""select event"" screen

in an old save file, i've also had this happen with the ""return to select event"" option at the end of an event, but i haven't been able to reproduce that.

on `zoomend` i perform a request to the backend for data. 

i can disable `touchzoom`, `scrollwheelzoom`, `doubleclickzoom` and `boxzoom` on the map but i can't see any way to disable the zoom control buttons (`[+]` and `[-]`) because the user is still currently able to click these to change the zoom whilst data for the previous zoom level is still being requested from the database.

i want to prevent further zoom changes to the map whilst the data is being requested.

is there a way to disable the zoom control buttons without just making them `visibility: hidden`, then `visibility: visible` again when the data has been returned from the database?

i have the same callback function for `dragend` but just disabling `dragging` on the map seems to be working fine for this.

313,47389037,word2vec model to dict; adding to the word2vec to production pipeline,"a lot of users use their trained `word2vec` model in production environments to get `most_similar` words to (for example) words in a user's entered query, or words in complete documents, on the fly. in times like these, using the word2vec model becomes very cumbersome, *often taking the most amount of time in the pipeline.* [1]

what i propose is a `model_to_dict` method, to be used right at the end of the word2vec pipeline. it would find and store, in preproduction, all most similar words to all words in the trained vocabulary.

the most similar words can be from a custom user list as in #1229 and we can allow the user to define a custom preprocessing function to pass all most similar words through before storing them. being a dict, the query time will also be minimal which is great for this purpose! since our dict just stores words, the size of the dict should be comparable to a multiple of the size of the vocab [2]

at the end of this, we expect a dictionary with keys as word2vec vocab and values as the most_similar words to them. words in vocab that have empty most_similar words will not be stored in the dict. this will happen a lot if there is a custom results list as well as a pass function for result words applied on top of most similar cutoff.

[1] this is because we always calculate all cos distances from the query word to all words in vocab before returning topn most similar words. i can't think of a better way for that, yet.
[2] albeit a large multiple if users do not provide proper preprocessing pass function or have a small similarity cutoff. maybe we can give them a warning about the same.

337,22483047,more detail on cause of allocation failure / unassigned shards,"i have done a few tests in difference scenarios, in order to find the reason why shards are unassigned.   it seems as if there could be some improvements by providing the real, human readable reason why a shard is in unassigned state.

possible end reasons (for failed allocation) would include 
 more replicas than nodes
 low disk watermark
 corruption
 forced allocation awareness
 bad routing

in the scenarios that i was able to reproduce, the _unassigned reason_, and _unassigned details_ did not assist in learning the real cause.  

in allocation awareness and low disk watermark tests, no _unassigned.details_ were available, and the _unassigned.reason_ was not helpful in learning the user error.  both tests had similar results:


a node left test resulted in a useful _reason_ and a _unassigned.details_ string, but the latter was not human-friendly:

385,62421423,promisify of method without last argument callback - undefined beahvior,"currently, our documentation states:

> promisify() assumes that original is a function taking a callback as its final argument in all cases, and the returned function will result in undefined behavior if it does not.

however, `undefined behavior` is a very ""harsh"" way to put what happens (since it implies the process can crash) and the behavior is pretty well defined.

 if a non function is passed in - `promisify` throws. https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/lib/internal/util.js#l257-l259
 if a function is passed but  its `promisify.custom` is specified but not a function - it throws.
 if a function is passed, but its last argument is not a node style callback - it will treat it 'as if' its last argument is a node style callback - and will pass one to it as the last argument.

it won't do something _useful_ but the behavior is defined.

i think our documentation should be amended to explain that the undefined behavior here isn't ""as undefined"" as writing out of bounds of a buffer for example.

i'm marking this as ""good first issue"", and ""mentor available"" in case someone wants to pr this but isn't sure how and would like guidance.

i'm not quite sure whether it is really a bug or i just did something wrong but i have some issues getting data from a `belongstomany` association which itself has another `hasmany` association which i want to limit to only 1 result in one certain case.

i have a `product` model which _has_ many `productimages` and _belongs to_ many `productcategories`. when i try to get all _products_ of a certain _category_ with only the first _product image_ included, i get an error _invalid scope 'overview' called_ - overview is the scope i use to get only the first product image as preview.

if i get the product directly via `product.scope('overview').findall()` everything works fine. i've already tried `separate: true` but with no success.

i created a fully executable gist so you can have a look: https://gist.github.com/manuelbieh/b0ec0f41614cf9924b14

(mysql version here: https://gist.github.com/manuelbieh/a7a0aa14b3ef53e0bb78)

any idea what i've done wrong and/or how it can be fixed? or is it really a bug?

maybe a short explanation of what i want to do to get some context: i have a page with a _category_ page where a user can see all _products_ of that particular _category_. for each _product_ in that list i want to show the product's first _image_ as preview, so i really need only the first image. how can i realize that?

we can use the `exclude_pattern` feature to (for example) exclude urls from what's matched; ideally, we'd be able to remove some of the `excldue`.  just search the file to see how it works.

this is a good first issue for someone who's willing to spend significant time reading about how our linter framework works.

your environment
* raspberry pi 3 b v1.2
* 2017-11-29 stretch lite
* raspap quick install
* other software or services running with raspap:  ssh

steps to reproduce

install the latest stretch lite image onto a raspberry pi 3 b model.
enable and start ssh:  `systemctl enable ssh && systemctl start ssh`
execute the raspap-webgui quick installer:  `wget -q https://git.io/voeuq -o /tmp/raspap && bash /tmp/raspap`

expected behaviour
i would expect to see several networks.  instead, there are none.

actual behaviour
no networks are visibile.

if i manually specify `wlan0`, there are results:

450,5283285,map stops working if the map is re-centered right after the map initialization.,"updated as of comment https://github.com/leaflet/leaflet/issues/2071#issuecomment-25771614
issue summary

map stops working (loading tiles) if map is recentered the map is created. this issue happens only when a starting map (including tile layer, center, and zoom) is available.
adding a 1ms delay avoids this bug.

(i've realized it with l.geojson layer in addion to l.tilelayer, not sure if it also happens with other layer types)
how to reproduce

(updated as of comment https://github.com/leaflet/leaflet/issues/2071#issuecomment-25771614 )  
it took me a long time and many trials to make the js fiddle because the same coordinates was not buggy on the fiddle. using different coordinates lead the bug on js fiddle.
i also realize that adding more random scripts to the scripts stack may avoid the bug.
buggy fiddle:

http://jsfiddle.net/sa7bq/9/
there 4 ways to avoid the bug:
 comment the lines 12 and 13 (center and zoom). example:
http://jsfiddle.net/sa7bq/10/
 uncomment line 54 to create a 1ms delay before re-centering the map. example:
http://jsfiddle.net/sa7bq/11/
 different coordinates may lead to bug or not in different machines. in may local machine i have the features using the coordinates [-43.9281714, -19.8756538]  and [-43.9373343, -19.9240936], leading to the bug. however, in jsfiddle the i got the bug changing the second coordinate to [-43.9373343, -19.8756538]. example of bug not happening anymore by just switching the coordinate on lines 47 and 48:
http://jsfiddle.net/sa7bq/12/
 as i said before, adding more random scripts to the stack may also avoid the bug.
i could not reproduce this behavior on jsfiddle, however, in my local machine, adding `jquery ui` and `jquery ui autocomplete` avoided the bug.

yarn 0.19.1 does not support this. you can add a package that has a package.json like this, but if you try to run yarn install after that, it will fail.

yarn-error.log:


i also tested with a non-array comment package in my package.json, in that case the error was: ""received malformed response from registry for undefined. the registry may be down.""

if the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.

yarn init
yarn add keyczarjs
yarn install

what is the expected behavior?

yarn install works. yarn ignores the ""//"" package.

please mention your node.js, yarn and operating system version.

click on the option import/export on the right-hand side of the page that appears a an icon with two arrows going horizontally outward in the opposite directions on it.
click on the button ""browse""
browse for a video file

529,26908680,add feature to delete pid file on clean shutdown,"this will allow external scripts to verify that mailpile shut down cleanly.

doing this cleanly is actually a bit involved, as the internal pluggable lifecycle-hook code is incomplete; it lacks a hook that fires after all the app data has been written out, and it also lacks a way for internal code to register hooks (currently only plugins with a manifest can register lifecycle hooks).

steps to fix:
rename plugins.process_shutdown_hooks() to plugins.process_lifecycle(event)
add a method to plugins, to register lifecycle callbacks from internal code
enhance plugins.process_lifecycle() to  process the internal callbacks too
add a new lifecycle hook to the _very end_ of app.main()
make commands.writepid register a lifecycle callback to delete the pidfile.

as a data scientist using pysyft's floattensor type, i want to leverage a wide range of methods which use our new unity backend. for this ticket to be complete, the sqrt() should be added to our floattensor class with the appropriate functionality, returning a new tensor.

furthermore, the function should automatically determine which backend to use (cpu/gpu) based on where the data is located. if the data is located on the cpu, a performant cpu implementation should run but if the data for a given floattensor is located on a gpu, it should be run using an hlsl kernel where appropriate. obviously, if no gpu is available, it should automatically fall back to the cpu implementation.

every reference you might need for this issue:

custom map panes would solve this problem and give the user a lot more fine tuned control over their groups of layers and how they are displayed and interacted with.

how to fix

 read through the linked issue and understand the problem. 
 replicate the failure on your machine. 
 fix the test (probably using one of the methods suggested above).
 move the test back to `test/parallel/` (it's currently in `test/sequential/`).

589,33836947,move zulip's prompt for permission to display notifications to be manually triggered,"as brought up in #883, i think we can probably simultaneously work around the issue there and improve the zulip user experience by deferring the ""allow notifications"" popup until after the user has finished the tutorial (it's kinda confusing that it pops up when it does already).

while we're at it, we probably want to make the browser popup be triggered from a message that's part of the zulip app and explains that notifications are important and the user should accept, to help ensure users don't just auto-block zulip notifications out of habit.

i think it's definitely possible for a frontend to tell whether notifications have been denied (i'm pretty sure i've seen products display a ""you turned off notifications, can you click this?"" message). and https://developer.mozilla.org/en-us/docs/web/api/notification/permission seems to confirm you can see if they've been explicitly denied.

so a good implementation plan here would be:
 build a nice warning message panel (can come down from the top of the center pane) that asks users to enable desktop notifications, and has a button to trigger the prompt for access.
 make that warning prompt show up if the user hasn't granted permissions and the tutorial is finished (can probably just use tutorial.defer() to make this code run at the right time)
 have a slightly different message for the case that the user has explicitly denied desktop notifications permission.

when using https.createserver, passing a boolean to cert and/or key will not cause an error, but will result in an invalid certificate at runtime. for instance:

i discovered this with a pretty silly code mistake like:



for invalid types, there could probably be an error thrown rather than issuing a completely invalid certificate. though it would be overkill to validate certs at runtime rather than time of connection, checking for valid types might be a good idea since there's currently (as far as i can tell) no difference between this mistake and a totally invalid certificate, making it hard to debug. instead a non-string, non-object (for key), non-buffer should probably be functionally identical to having *no* certificate.

changing attributes of `light` components works great in general, but i think there's a bug specifically when changing the `groundcolor` on a hemisphere light.

as demonstrated in the codepen example linked below, setting the `color`of a hemisphere light run time works as expected, but setting the `groundcolor` results in the whole model being rendered without any light on it at all.

i would expect to be able to change the `groundcolor` just as i can change the `color` of a hemisphere light.

* platform: linux

thankfully the actual implementation throws a generic error with the string `failed to translate buffer to a ec_point`, at least when i test it with prime256v1. i was hoping for a more catchable-friendly error, at least having a documented type or error code so it's easily distinguished to other errors. as far as my brain goes, i cannot find a single use case where one would not also want to check for this error since it's not a programmer error but always a possible user-input error.


my proposal is to first change the code to use some kind of typed error so it can be easily identified for this specific case and then update the documentation to catch this error in the example code as well as document in the `computesecret` method how the invalid point error is reported. the example currently only uses `assert.strictequal` to confirm that the two values are equal.

684,59503092,"compose: adding an attachment, emoji, video link, etc should prepend a space if needed.","we currently have 4 different pieces of code that handle inline pasting of images, adding attachments, inserting emoji from the picker, and adding a video link (once https://github.com/zulip/zulip/pull/6083 is merged). they all do slightly different things, but we should unify them. 

tim code we used for the emoji picker as `compose_state.insert_syntax_and_focus`.  so we should plan to do 2 things: 

(1) migrate the other code paths that directly edit the `$('#new_message_content')` to instead call `compose_state.insert_syntax_and_focus`.  let's start with this, since it's probably easier.

(2) modify `compose_state.insert_syntax_and_focus` to have the following behavior: inserts the text at the cursor, adding a space after if there isn't one already, and adding a space at the beginning if the previous character is not a newline, space, tab, or start-of-message. 

(doing so will likely involve some fancy mechanics with `$.caret` and maybe `$.range` from jquery-caret.  see the `textarea.range` code in `static/js/composebox_typeahead.js` for some example code that does this sort of thing.

689,33841516,firefox hack for `onselect` is leaky without a noop `onkeyup`,"do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?

bug.

what is the current behavior?


however, if you haven't added an `onkeyup` handler to your component, the `keyup` part of the selection listening hack for firefox won't ever fire. which means if you happen to be doing something in `onkeydown` that changes the selection, it won't be caught by `keyup` as expected, such that the next time `keydown` fires, the `onselect` handler will be triggered (via the `keydown` part of the hack), since react thinks the selection has changed.

example:
 you place your cursor at the end of a sentence.
 `onselect` fires thanks to `mouseup`.
 `render` updates the selection.
 you `backspace` the last `.` character:
 `onkeydown` you handle deleting the character, and preventing default.
 `onselect` doesn't fire, because on change hasn't taken place yet, as expected.
 `render` updates the selection.
 you `backspace` another character:
 `onkeydown` you handle deleting another character.
 `onselect` fires thanks to `onkeydown`, but its internal state is comparing it to the selection before it was updated by `render`, so it is out of date. not expected.

if you add a noop handler for `onkeyup`, this problem goes away, since `onselect` will always fire after rendering thanks to `keyup`, and then it will never fire incorrectly due to `keydown`. 


what is the expected behavior?

ideally i'd think that the `keyup` event hack would still fire even without having to have the developer add a `onkeyup` noop to their `contenteditable` component?

which versions of react, and which browser / os are affected by this issue? did this work in previous versions of react?

react 15 in firefox.

a little something that might have to do with pointer event handing for ie11. try any map with a zoom component in ie11 like http://leafletjs.com/. click the zoom buttons, they will keep the ""leaflet-active"" class, even after you pushed them.

this class should be removed when up.

this might have to do with this issue #2102 because the ""_onup"" function is never called.

in pointer.js, i believe there is an issue. in the function addpointerlistenerend:
this._pointers is undefined so no touch id is sent to the event

it might lead to bigger issues, although i didn't experience any other bad effect

739,65162393,urlhost not robust when re-setting its value,"* version: master
* platform: all
* subsystem: url, src

currently, the `setopaque()` and `setdomain()` methods of `urlhost` class in `node_url.cc` always overwrite the existing string in `value_` without disposing of the original value in that union.

https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/a3555d0583452bec05e339bf2872cbb4e38236c9/src/node_url.cc#l95-l112

this could cause a memory leak when these two methods are used on an instance of the class on which one of these two methods has already been called.

right now that never happens because of the way the url parsing state machine is designed, but ideally these two methods should first call `this->~urlhost()` to free any memory already allocated before reinitializing the `value` through the `new` placement.

758,61123985,[tracking issue] converting tests to use countdown,"one possible set of tasks that i can suggest for new contributors who are bit more confident in their node.js skills, would be converting tests to use the new `../common/countdown` utility module.

for instance, if you take a look at: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/test/parallel/test-http2-client-destroy.js, you'll see that there is a remaining counter (https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/test/parallel/test-http2-client-destroy.js#l19). the test then counts down remaining before closing the server. there are quite a large number of tests in our suite that perform similar actions in ways that are rather inconsistent. the ../common/countdown utility was designed to bring some consistency there.

the way the countdown utility works is straightforward:


i know that there are quite a few of the http2 tests that can benefit from this, along with a bunch of other http and https tests.

these tasks would be for folks who are a bit more comfortable with their node.js skills.

there are *many* tests in the suite that could be modified to use this new utility. however, rather than modifying them all at once, if a new contributor wishes to take this on, please one change one or two at a time, leaving other tests for other contributors to pick up on. just reference this tracking issue in the commit/pr so that we can keep track.

766,63779529,fasttext memory usage greatly exceeds value returned by `estimate_memory`,"description
when using `gensim.models.fasttext.fasttext`, the actual memory usage is much higher (>2x) than predicted by `fasttext.estimate_memory`.
my usage scenario is to generate 300-dimensional word embeddings using skipgram training with window size 8. my corpus has ~55,000,000 documents with ~4,144,457 word types across ~20,000,000,000 tokens. the machine has 16gb of available memory, 15gb of which are available for the gensim process, as well as 16gb of swap space.

the estimated memory usage is ~11.2gb (see below), which is identical to the size estimated for the word2vec model with the same parameters. training with word2vec works flawlessly and uses almost exactly as much memory as estimated.

it seems that `fasttext` does not implement its own `estimate_memory` method, but inherits it from the `word2vec` class, yielding unreliable values as can be seen below.  the critical section where the most memory is used seems to be this part in `fasttext.init_ngrams`:


steps/code/corpus to reproduce


expected results
should finish training without running out of memory.

actual results

772,61123985,[tracking issue] converting tests to use countdown,"one possible set of tasks that i can suggest for new contributors who are bit more confident in their node.js skills, would be converting tests to use the new `../common/countdown` utility module.

for instance, if you take a look at: https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/test/parallel/test-http2-client-destroy.js, you'll see that there is a remaining counter (https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/test/parallel/test-http2-client-destroy.js#l19). the test then counts down remaining before closing the server. there are quite a large number of tests in our suite that perform similar actions in ways that are rather inconsistent. the ../common/countdown utility was designed to bring some consistency there.

the way the countdown utility works is straightforward:


i know that there are quite a few of the http2 tests that can benefit from this, along with a bunch of other http and https tests.

these tasks would be for folks who are a bit more comfortable with their node.js skills.

there are *many* tests in the suite that could be modified to use this new utility. however, rather than modifying them all at once, if a new contributor wishes to take this on, please one change one or two at a time, leaving other tests for other contributors to pick up on. just reference this tracking issue in the commit/pr so that we can keep track.

the bug refers  to the phpoffice\phpspreadsheet\reader\html::canread($filename). 
to return true if a valid html file(path) is served.

what is the current behavior?

if the filesize is smaller than 2048 the value of the self::test_sample_size the function
will always return false since inside the  html::readending() nothing is read by the
fread($this->filehandle, $blocksize).

i suspect this is caused by the  fact that html::readbegining() is reading after eof and
fseek($this->filehandle, $size - $blocksize); does not have the expected behaviour.

because of this issue i'm unable to load any html file that has a size smaller than 2048.

this seems very broken because it doesn't make sense to ever have max statements be 0 per line, and we already have `no-empty` to catch empty blocks. 

i think we should fix this by:
ensuring `max` is 1 or larger
removing the empty block check

this would be semver-patch because we are reducing the number of warnings this rule produces.

865,13170181,support nested maildirs,"mailpile currently does not understand nested maildirs. it would be nice if it did. if i understand this bug correctly, nested maildirs are maildirs that in addition to the new/cur/tmp folders, may have other folders which themselves are maildirs.

supporting nested maildirs is requires augmenting the addmailboxes command in `commands.py` so it doesn't just add discovered mailboxes, but actually looks inside them as well, if they are folders. care must be taken to ignore the new/cur/tmp folders though, as otherwise individual messages might get added as mailboxes.

notes:
 this issue replaces #428, which contained a bunch of details about symptoms relating to this limitation, where the user had moved mail into a subfolder, thus rendering it invisible to mailpile.
 the approach described above has the limitation that new subfolders won't get picked up unless the user re-runs the add command on the same mailbox. this can be ignored for now, as it will get addressed by the re-factoring work done for imap, where the same kind of discovery of new/renamed folders is a requirement.

scripts $ ruby porter_stemmer.rb
shiny
shini

i checked this against the nltk:

scripts $ python
python 2.6.1 (r261:67515, jun 24 2010, 21:47:49)
[gcc 4.2.1 (apple inc. build 5646)] on darwin
type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.


'shini'

so far, so good. and if i compare these results to the expected results (output.txt) provided on the same page for a sample user dict file (voc.txt), they look right:

scripts $ egrep -n '^shiny$' voc.txt
18333:shiny
scripts $ egrep -n '^shini$' output.txt
18333:shini

but if i systematically compare the nltk results against those in the expected results file, i see a lot of discrepancies (format: word, proper expected stemming, bad nltk stemming marked by asterisk):

scripts $ ./show_bad_stemming_in_nltk.py voc.txt output.txt
abbey abbei *abbey
abbeys abbei *abbey
abed ab *abe
absey absei *absey
[...]
wrying wry *wri
yesterday yesterdai *yesterday
yesterdays yesterdai *yesterday
yongrey yongrei *yongrey

spot checking against the ruby reference implemenation confirms that the nltk results are in fact the problem:

scripts $ ruby porter_stemmer.rb
abbey
abbei
abbeys
abbei
abed
ab
absey
absei
wrying
wry
yesterday
yesterdai
yesterdays
yesterdai
yongrey
yongrei

i've attached the full list of words for which the nltk's porter stemmer provides unexpected results.

(this bug pertains to version 2.0b9. i suspect it exists in all previous versions, but i haven't confirmed that.)

929,53604417,issues with guava 23.0rc1 in urlchecker.java class,"meta -
os:  windows 7

selenium version:  3.4.0

browser:  chrome

browser version:  59.0.3071.86

expected behavior -
https://github.com/seleniumhq/selenium/blob/d37a5cc4e853b35283ae4ebf1daca2d0b1e95a37/java/client/src/org/openqa/selenium/net/urlchecker.java#l67

this urlchecker class should on construction create an instance of itself using a new simpletimelimiter. 
simpletimelimiter comes from the guava project. this should run and return correctly.

actual behavior -
as of guava 23.0r1, the simpletimelimiter constructor being used is private, and this will cause an illegalaccesserror when creating a new instance of the urlchecker class.

you can see the new code for 23.0r1 that does this line 51 at: 
https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava/src/com/google/common/util/concurrent/simpletimelimiter.java#l51

however, you can see on line 67:
https://github.com/google/guava/blob/master/guava/src/com/google/common/util/concurrent/simpletimelimiter.java#l67

that the developers have added in a create method. 
it could be fixed as simply by changing:
`public urlchecker() {
this(simpletimelimiter.create(thread_pool));
}`

however, it seems that older version of guava may not have included this create method, so this may not work unless a full transition to 23.0 is made in the future when it is actually released.

steps to reproduce -
create a new instance of the chromedriver or attempt to call the default constructor on the urlchecker class while having guava 23.0rc1 as your current version of guava.

this is a minor issue as you can prevent this error from occurring by downgrading your guava version, however, it is something that may need to be considered going forward.

this looks like some debug assert code under rct_debug, i removed it and tried going past the issue but the application still crashed. (so must be something serious)

i've been trying to get the full testsuite to run while building a docker image based on `from alpine:latest`. the `parallel/test-setproctitle.js` seems to be the only failing test. thats due to busybox ps doesn't support the `-p` switch. installing procps package before compiling/testing solves this but could the test instead be refactored to remove this dependency? using either `/proc/[pid]/comm` or `/proc/[pid]/stat` directly instead?

problem is, as these dependencies exist at various levels inside the node_modules tree, it's a pain in the ass to write a regex for `babel/register` that matches all my internal dependencies, while trivial to implement as a function. unfortunately, there's currently no way to use custom logic to determine what gets included or not; must use regex edit: or glob. this problem would go away if it were possible to pass a function as `babel/register`'s `ignore/only` options.

previously i was in a rush, so i'd simply monkeypatched `util.shouldignore` to implement the logic i needed, but this new internal api protection put the kibosh on that and reminds me that i should look into a less hacky solution.

974,44344641,save slot display always zero on save/load,"first and foremost consider this:
 only retroarch bugs should be filed here. not core bugs or game bugs
 this is not a forum or a help section, this is strictly developer oriented

description

in retroarch 4.1.14 the on screen notification always says ""saving/loading data from slot #0"" no matter which save slot is actually selected.

i am able to iterate through the save slots.  i can save and load from any slot as expected.  however, even when loading a game from slot #2 the message incorrectly states slot #0 on screen.

expected behavior

i expect the slot # message to accurately reflect the slot that has been selected.  if i am saving to slot #2 i expect the message to say ""saving to slot #2"". 

if i am loading a game from slot #1 i expect it to say ""loading game from slot #1""  or some approxomation.  the important part here is that the save slot increment should be correct.

actual behavior

no matter which save/load slot is selected the message on screen when loading/saving a state always says slot #0.

steps to reproduce the bug

install/update retroarch on retropie to the latest version.  i believe it is 4.1.14.
save a game in slot #1.  the message will say saving to slot #0.
also try loading from slot#1.  again the message will incorrectly state it is loading from slot #0.

bisect results

i believe this started happening after updating retroarch on retropie last week.

i'll have to double check but another user on the retropie forum indicated the version is 4.1.14

975,3067970,zoom controls incorrectly disabled?,"hi,

see this jsfiddle: http://jsfiddle.net/g7cdk/

i've set map.maxzoom to 20 and osm.maxzoom to 14. before you ask, i've got a custom tile layer which i don't want to render - but would ideally like to display at low resolution - beyond level 14 - i'm just using osm here as an example!

if the tile layer is turned on, it overrides the map's maxzoom. this seems counter-intuitive to me - i still want to be able to zoom in and look at the vector layer. the current behaviour would only really make sense to me if the geojson layer also had a setting for maxzoom.

ideal solutions for me would be: (1) vector layers would have built-in minzoom/maxzoom options; (2) tiled layers would use lower resolution tiles if outside of their specified zoom levels; or as a last resort (3) the tiled layer would just become invisible if outside its scale range.

what do you think?

thanks...

what is the expected behavior?

should create a folder in home/yarn-caches and use it for caches.
currently ~ is not interpreted as home and yarn just creates folder named `~` in cwd of yarn execution.

this will be useful for multiple yarn commands, so it would be nice to make this generic.

would it be welcome to introduce an option in the `no-magic-number` rule such that number literals used to access array indexes are not considered magic numbers?
**what you did.**


eslint complains about `3` (c) and `4`(d), but it would also complain about `1` and `2` if they weren't default exceptions.
**what you would like to happen.**

with the proper option, the `no-magic-number` would not flag syntax that follows the `array[#]` format where `#` is a number literal.
**what actually happened.**

that currently is an error.

thank you!

1021,38968016,original url('srcpath') string is not maintained in element,"description:

i'm writing a a-frame dom->json scene save/loader.

obj-models that have property ""obj: url(assets/asset.obj)"" (and mtls) get their sources trimmed. when iterating through the elements, you get something like this:

object {mtl: ""assets/asset.mtl"", obj: ""assets/asset.obj""}

when loading this back as an element by doing:
element.setattribute( propertyname, propertyobject );

a-frame will throw an error:

aframe.js:62939 uncaught (in promise) domexception: failed to execute 'queryselector' on 'document': 'assets/blackcw_rand_lod0.mtl' is not a valid selector.

this is because 

the url('') part is stripped and

this function

function assetparse (value) {
var parsedurl = value.match(/\url\((.+)\)/);
...

is too lax with matching url() and when that fails it looks for an element id immediately. 

what i think a-frame should do is match the url('') part, then if that fails, match the hashtag ('#') part for an existing element, then finally if all else fails, simply load the argument as the url.

either that, or provide the original, unmodified string with the url('') in-tact.

https://codepen.io/anon/pen/dvjrba

steps to reproduce the problem

put popper outside of reference's scrollparent
use scrollparent as boundarieselement

what is the expected behavior?

popper should try to keep inside reference's scrollparent

what went wrong?
popper's scrollparent is used as boundarieselement

1100,59689785,bug in sklearn_api.hdp and in sklearn_api.ldamodel,"

description
the new `sklearn_api.hdp` (and also `ldamodel`) modules and/or their combination with `matutils.sparse2corpus` yield the wrong results when fitting models from sklearn vectorizers or other sklearn-styled sparse matrices, since they are stored in csr format. this error might occur in other sklearn_api classes, too.

i believe that either the default value of sparse2corpus constructor's `documents_columns` parameter should be changed:


or the following call should include that `documents_columns=false`:




steps/code/corpus to reproduce

example: the number of processed documents corresponds to the number of features.


expected results
we should expect that the hdp gensim model had processed the 100 documents in samples.

actual results
hdp processed 6547 documents

workaround, for the record
to make it work correctly, the sparse matrix `x` should be transposed.

there is no documentation for loading an .obj with .mtl in <a-obj-model>. 

looking at the source code, you need to specify the path to the .mtl-file. but doing exactly that, lets say with

the error happens because of this:
text in a ""src"" attribute, like src=""myurl"" is automatically converted into ""url(myurl)"". the function srcparse() recognizes this and treats it accordingly. for ""mtl"" attributes, this doesn't happen. they are not transformed into ""url(myurl.mtl)"" and not recognized in srcparse().

the <a-obj-model> apparently gets an attribute called ""obj-model"" set somewhere, and it's set to


you can circumvent it by using it like this:

go to the ""browse"" tab of any table

on mgba, the floor surfaces in these levels are visually misaligned with the actual track layout. you'll constantly hit invisible obstacles and fly off the track because the graphics don't match the collision. jumping also causes the floor to jerk and shift violently.

i'll attach several savestates taken at the entrances to the affected levels (press up on the dpad to enter the levels). they're taken from the us version of the game. and here are examples of what the levels are supposed to look like without the glitch-

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8svsl0gjaqc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i_dusxbuo4o


incidentally, i haven't tested rayman raving rabbids on mgba yet but the game shares a lot in common with rayman 3 gba (same visuals and gameplay, i suspect the same engine, it's basically rayman 3 gba's sequel). it also shares the same kind of ""mode7"" levels and i wonder if they are also broken..

in case this info is necessary, this issue is present on both the 0.4.1 stable built as well as the 0.5-3929-d8c773b nightly, both downloaded off the official mgba site. the glitch is present across all devices i've tested on. my pc has windows 10 64 bit, an intel core i5 4670k and an evga 1060. the newest mgba core running via retroarch android also exhibits the same issue.

first, i was playing pokemon prism, and at the start of the game i did my best to set the in-game clock to the same date/ time as my 3ds. however, after playing the game for a while, i saved the game (and also did a savestate) and closed mgba, and when i reopened it and started playing the game again, i noticed that the in-game clock was behind my system time by roughly the amount of time i had stopped playing. however, i believe this is incorrect behavior, as the in-game clock should be kept in sync with the system time.

furthermore, whenever i put the 3ds into sleep mode with the game open, the in-game time speeds up by a considerable amount. i started playing the game on saturday july 22, and after leaving the system asleep for a day or two, my in-game clock said that the date was somewhere in the middle of october! and when i opened the game today, it now says it's december. even if mgba isn't supposed to manually change the rtc to the system time, i believe that the rtc still shouldn't run so fast when the system is in sleep mode.

what is the current behavior?
~ is not properly evaluated when used in the `cafile` directive in .npmrc

if the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce.

consider the scenario of a private npm registry that uses a self-signed ssl certificate. a user's ~/.npmrc would look like this:

running `yarn install` results in this error message: `error could not open cafile: enoent: no such file or directory, open '~/custom-certs.pem'`

if you change the cafile directive to `cafile=/users/kevin/custom-certs.pem` then `yarn install` works fine.

use of ~ in cafile should expand to the user's home directory. it should do the same expansion in other directives that accept file paths.

notice in the console, that the log inside the callback is logging that `e.target === null` evaluates to `true`. in my app, i'm passing the `event` to an `onchange` handler which utilizes the `target`. so this update breaks that situation.

this may or may not be a bug. it may just be necessary for avoiding the memory leak. if that's the case, then it's a support request :smile: how should i handle this if i'm passing the `event` to another callback and i want that event to have references to things like `target`?

I expected this code to throw since `sandbox.restore` doesn't take any arguments.

``` js
const sinon = require(""sinon"")

const sandbox = sinon.sandbox.create();
sandbox.restore('foo', 'bar');
```

I've found that in a couple places in our code base, engineers think they can restore an individual stub by calling:

``` js
sandbox.restore(stub);
```

Which actually restores **all** stubs

Whereas they should be calling:

``` js
stub.restore();
```

I've been thinking of how I should address this problem, possibly by using a linter or by monkey patching the library. However, I figure that more than just our team has run into this and this is a thing sinon itself can protect engineers from doing.

- Mailing List: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gensim
For more information, see Recipes&FAQ: https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/wiki/Recipes-&-FAQ
-->

<!-- Instructions For Filing a Bug: https://github.com/RaRe-Technologies/gensim/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md -->

#### Description
The new `sklearn_api.hdp` (and also `ldamodel`) modules and/or their combination with `matutils.Sparse2Corpus` yield the wrong results when fitting models from sklearn vectorizers or other sklearn-styled sparse matrices, since they are stored in CSR format. This error might occur in other sklearn_api classes, too.

I believe that either the default value of Sparse2Corpus constructor's `documents_columns` parameter should be changed:

```python
class Sparse2Corpus(object):
    """"""
    Convert a matrix in scipy.sparse format into a streaming gensim corpus.
    This is the mirror function to `corpus2csc`.
    """"""

    # Change this to def __init__(self, sparse, documents_columns=False) ?
    def __init__(self, sparse, documents_columns=True):
        if documents_columns:
            self.sparse = sparse.tocsc()
        else:
            self.sparse = sparse.tocsr().T  # make sure shape[1]=number of docs (needed in len())
```

or the following call should include that `documents_columns=False`:

```python
# Same happens in lda model
class HdpTransformer(TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):
    ...
    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        """"""
        Fit the model according to the given training data.
        Calls gensim.models.HdpModel
        """"""
        if sparse.issparse(X):
            corpus = matutils.Sparse2Corpus(X) # Change to matutils.Sparse2Corpus(X, False) ?
        ...
```


<!-- Example: Vocabulary size is not what I expected when training Word2Vec. -->

#### Steps/Code/Corpus to Reproduce

Example: The number of processed documents corresponds to the number of features.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
from gensim.sklearn_api.hdp import HdpTransformer

# Small dataset configuration
ngs = fetch_20newsgroups()
samples = ngs.data[:100]

# Simple count vectorization
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
# x is a sparse matrix
x = vectorizer.fit_transform(samples)
print(""%d documents, %d features"" % x.shape) # 100 documents, 6547 features

inv_vocab = {v: k for k, v in vectorizer.vocabulary_.items()}

# Train a HDP
hdp_transformer = HdpTransformer(inv_vocab)
hdp_transformer.fit(x)

# Should be 100 but got 6547
print(""Processed documents %d"" % hdp_transformer.gensim_model.m_num_docs_processed) # 6547
```

#### Expected Results
We should expect that the hdp gensim model had processed the 100 documents in samples.
```python
print(""%d documents, %d features"" % x.shape)
# 100 documents, 6547 features
```

#### Actual Results
HDP processed 6547 documents
```python
print(""Processed documents: %d"" % hdp_transformer.gensim_model.m_num_docs_processed)
# Processed documents: 6547
```

#### Workaround, for the record
To make it work correctly, the sparse matrix `x` should be transposed.
```python
vectorizer = CountVectorizer()
x = vectorizer.fit_transform(samples)
inv_vocab = {v: k for k, v in vectorizer.vocabulary_.items()}

hdp_transformer = HdpTransformer(inv_vocab)
hdp_transformer.fit(x.T)
```

## Expected Behavior
<!---
    If you're describing a bug, tell us what should happen.
    If you're suggesting a change/improvement, tell us how it should work.
-->

Hi, Im trying to use the updated `Hidden` with `initialWidth`

Not sure which one of these is correct:

```
<Hidden xsDown initialWidth={100}>
</Hidden>
<Hidden xsDown initialWidth={""xs""}>
</Hidden>
```
Either option gives me a warning

> Warning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop `initialWidth` of type `string` supplied to `Hidden`, expected `number`.
>     in Hidden

> Warning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop `initialWidth` of value `100` supplied to `WithWidth(HiddenJs)`, expected one of [""xs"",""sm"",""md"",""lg"",""xl""].
>     in WithWidth(HiddenJs)

> Warning: Failed prop type: Invalid prop `width` of type `number` supplied to `HiddenJs`, expected `string`.

I dont see the property on Hidden.d.ts either in HiddenProps/HiddenJsProps

## Current Behavior
<!---
    If describing a bug, tell us what happens instead of the expected behavior.
    If suggesting a change/improvement, explain the difference from current behavior.

Looking into the source

HiddenJs suggests it should be a number
https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/b72e77151659484c4c1a4a3853e66ee742d1a845/src/Hidden/HiddenJs.js#L98

However `initialWidth` also gets passed into `withWidth`
https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/b72e77151659484c4c1a4a3853e66ee742d1a845/src/Hidden/HiddenJs.js#L153

Which expects a string
https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui/blob/b72e77151659484c4c1a4a3853e66ee742d1a845/src/utils/withWidth.js#L121

## Context
<!---
    How has this issue affected you? What are you trying to accomplish?
    Providing context helps us come up with a solution that is most useful in the real world.
-->

For the moment my workaround is this, which seems to do what I want (ie hidden on SSR)

```
var hiddenmdprops: any = {
	mdDown: true,
	initialWidth: 'md',
};	
<Hidden {...hiddenmdprops}>
</Hidden>
```
And just ignore the warning.

1240,53913780,PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Reader\Html::load not working for html files smaller than 2048 bytes.,"This is:

- [x] a bug report
- [ ] a feature request
- [ ] **not** a usage question (ask them on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/phpspreadsheet or https://gitter.im/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet)

### What is the expected behavior?

The bug refers  to the PhpOffice\PhpSpreadsheet\Reader\Html::canRead($filename). 
To return true if a valid html file(path) is served.

### What is the current behavior?

If the filesize is smaller than 2048 the value of the self::TEST_SAMPLE_SIZE the function
will always return false since inside the  Html::readEnding() nothing is read by the
fread($this->fileHandle, $blockSize).

I suspect this is caused by the  fact that Html::readBegining() is reading after EOF and
fseek($this->fileHandle, $size - $blockSize); does not have the expected behaviour.

Because of this issue I'm unable to load any html file that has a size smaller than 2048.

### What are the steps to reproduce?

Please provide a [Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example](http://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) of code that exhibits the issue without relying on an external Excel file or a web server:

1242,2013208,Adding a map resize event,"Hi, 

I often miss a ""resize"" event on the map container. I know I can create this by listening to window resize and then check if the size of the container div has changed, but it would be better to have this in the Leaflet core. It's especially useful when showing a Leaflet map in a responsive layout with custom layer controls etc.

To get this event with the current Leaflet core, I'm extending the _onResize method of L.Map:

```
_onResize: function () {

        newSize = new L.Point(this._container.clientWidth, this._container.clientHeight);

1269,22881265,limit fails when used with belongsToMany+hasMany association - even with separate: true,"Hi,

I'm not quite sure whether it is really a bug or I just did something wrong but I have some issues getting data from a `belongsToMany` association which itself has another `hasMany` association which I want to limit to only 1 result in one certain case.

I have a `Product` model which _has_ many `ProductImages` and _belongs to_ many `ProductCategories`. When I try to get all _products_ of a certain _category_ with only the first _product image_ included, I get an error _Invalid scope 'overview' called_ - overview is the scope I use to get only the first product image as preview.

If I get the product directly via `Product.scope('overview').findAll()` everything works fine. I've already tried `separate: true` but with no success.

I created a fully executable gist so you can have a look: https://gist.github.com/manuelbieh/b0ec0f41614cf9924b14

(MySQL Version here: https://gist.github.com/manuelbieh/a7a0aa14b3ef53e0bb78)

Any idea what I've done wrong and/or how it can be fixed? Or is it really a bug?

Maybe a short explanation of what I want to do to get some context: I have a page with a _category_ page where a user can see all _products_ of that particular _category_. For each _product_ in that list I want to show the product's first _image_ as preview, so I really need only the first image. How can I realize that?

- Leaflet version I'm using: 1.0.1 & 1.0.2
- Browser (with version) I'm using: Firefox 49.02 and Edge 25
- OS/Platform (with version) I'm using: MacOS 10.11.6 for Firefox/Windows 10 for Edge
- call LatLngBounds.contains with an object-style LatLng, e.g. `{lat:0,lon:0}`

## What behaviour I'm expecting and which behaviour I'm seeing

expecting: the function to return true or false
seeing: a null reference exception

## Minimal example reproducing the issue

http://codepen.io/plaidphantom/pen/YpVZap

I noticed this issue originally while using 1.0.1, but putting together the CodePen I tested it with 1.0.2 and get identical behavior.

According to the [LatLng](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.0.html#latlng) documentation i think this should work, as there's nothing ""noted otherwise"" on [.contains](http://leafletjs.com/reference-1.0.0.html#latlngbounds-contains)

1291,46037638,PushNotificationIOS.requestPermissions won't resolve if no event listeners are attached,"### Description

`RCTPushNotificationManager` uses `startObserving` to register for `RCTRegisterUserNotificationSettings`. According to [the docs](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/5e20b7bcfbefa9084ab6cdac9c24926ba8a64126/docs/NativeModulesIOS.md#optimizing-for-zero-listeners), the `startObserving` method won't be called until somebody subscribes to `NotificationManagerIOS`.

This means there is a scenario when the developer can call `requestPermissions` without subscribing to notifications first, but since `RCTPushNotificationManager` relies on `NSNotificationCenter` subscribtion, the result will never be returned.

This should be fairly straightforward to solve for somebody new to React Native. Feel free to send a PR!

### Reproduction

Have this in your JS file

```javascript
PushNotificationIOS.requestPermissions().then(console.log);
```

You'll see iOS permissions dialog, however pressing ""Allow"" won't resolve the promise and nothing will be printed to the console.

### Solution

Change the code to this, then uninstall and run the app again (needed to reset iOS permissions cache):

```javascript
PushNotificationIOS.addEventListener('localNotification', () => {});
PushNotificationIOS.requestPermissions().then(console.log);
```

Now ""Allow"" button will work as expected, the promise will be resolved and you'll see log entry.

### Additional Information

* Platform: iOS
* Operating System: macOS

else if (tag === 2) glyph.bitmap = pbf.readBytes();

1311,14726707,Disable zoom control buttons?,"Is it possible to disable the zoom control buttons?

On `zoomend` I perform a request to the backend for data. 

I can disable `touchZoom`, `scrollWheelZoom`, `doubleClickZoom` and `boxZoom` on the map but I can't see any way to disable the zoom control buttons (`[+]` and `[-]`) because the user is still currently able to click these to change the zoom whilst data for the previous zoom level is still being requested from the database.

I want to prevent further zoom changes to the map whilst the data is being requested.

Is there a way to disable the zoom control buttons without just making them `visibility: hidden`, then `visibility: visible` again when the data has been returned from the database?

I have the same callback function for `dragend` but just disabling `dragging` on the map seems to be working fine for this.

Thanks

1315,50122697,null pointer exception with token_count data type and indexing a null value,"**Elasticsearch version**: 5.4.0

**Plugins installed**: X-Pack

**JVM version** (`java -version`): 
```json
        ""version"": ""1.8.0_131"",
        ""vm_name"": ""OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM"",

        ""arch"": ""amd64"",
        ""version"": ""4.10.17-200.fc25.x86_64"",
```
Fedora 25

**Description of the problem including expected versus actual behavior**:

It looks like there is an issue with the handling of null values for the `token_count` data type. Trying to index a document that has a multi-field with a `token_count` data type results in a null  pointer exception.  It seems like `token_count` should support null values?

**Steps to reproduce**:

1. Create a mapping using a `token_count` field:

```json
PUT /test
{
  ""mappings"": {
    ""doc"": {
      ""properties"": {
        ""test"": {
          ""type"": ""keyword"",
          ""fields"": {
            ""nr"": {
              ""type"": ""token_count"",
              ""analyzer"": ""default""
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

2. Add a doc _without_ a null value works:

```json
POST /test/doc
{
  ""test"": ""1234 5678""
}
```

3. Add a doc _with_ a null value throws an exception:

```json
POST /test/doc
{
  ""test"": null
} 
```

Results in the following exception thrown back at the client:

```json
{
  ""error"": {
    ""root_cause"": [
      {
        ""type"": ""mapper_parsing_exception"",
        ""reason"": ""failed to parse [test.nr]""
      }
    ],
    ""type"": ""mapper_parsing_exception"",
    ""reason"": ""failed to parse [test.nr]"",
    ""caused_by"": {
      ""type"": ""null_pointer_exception"",
      ""reason"": null
    }
  },
  ""status"": 400
}
```

And I see the following thrown at DEBUG level in the Elasticsearch logs:

1324,34683947,`HTMLDOMPropertyConfig` contains non-standard `icon` property,"**Do you want to request a _feature_ or report a _bug_?**
Report a bug.

**What is the current behavior?**
The `HTMLDOMPropertyConfig` object [includes an `icon` property](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cccef3c68310df3bd611df2a7b98a530645c67c0/src/renderers/dom/shared/HTMLDOMPropertyConfig.js#L85) in a section title `Standard Properties`, but `icon` isn’t an attribute supported by any standard HTML element.

`icon` is not included in the HTML4 or HTML5 specs:
[List of HTML4 attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/html4/index/attributes.html)
[List of HTML5 attributes](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/index.html#attributes-1)

Mozilla Developer Network includes `icon` in its [list of attributes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes), but specifies the only element to use `icon` is the [obsolete `<command>` element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/command). `<command>` isn’t supported in [any desktop or mobile browser](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/command#Browser_compatibility).

**What is the expected behavior?**
The `icon` property might be better placed in the section titled [`Non-standard Properties`](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/cccef3c68310df3bd611df2a7b98a530645c67c0/src/renderers/dom/shared/HTMLDOMPropertyConfig.js#L174-L202), or removed altogether. The [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tags-and-attributes.html#html-attributes) for HTML attributes could omit `icon` too.

I encountered this issue when working with TypeScript, and I opened an issue about the React type definition at https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/10467. Because React itself includes `icon`, custom interfaces which extend [DefinitelyTyped’s `React.HTMLAttributes`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/613673de3672114c562fdf9f142bfeefc29173c9/react/react.d.ts#L1968) cannot include a non-string `icon` property.

**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue? Did this work in previous versions of React?**
`icon` was added in a React 0.4.0 alpha in 2013: https://github.com/facebook/react/commit/203dba271b6128f03c99b1ce2f573a316adb4e4e. The commit message mentions `mostly this was to better support some HTML5 stuff`—it’s possible `icon` was part of a draft of the HTML5 standard at the time, but was omitted in the final spec.

I expected an error to be reported, because [`eslint-disable-next-line`](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring#disabling-rules-with-inline-comments) is only supposed to work when using line comments.

**What actually happened? Please include the actual, raw output from ESLint.**

No error was reported, because ESLint considered the shebang to be a valid `eslint-disable-next-line` comment.

It looks like the issue is occurring as part of the inline comment processing [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/3c41a053026b502bc8ec3890e526f45129c84ebd/lib/linter.js#L339-L399). In a previous version of ESLint, `ast.comments` did not contain shebangs, so it was safe for that logic to assume that all comments in the array had a type of either `Block` or `Line`. However, `ast.comments` now includes shebang comments (they have type `Shebang`), so this is no longer a safe assumption.

There are a few different ways that this could be fixed:

* Filter out shebangs before doing any processing on them.
* Make the logic explicitly check that a comment has type `Line` before assuming that it's a line comment.",0,** shebang comment **what eslint-disable-next-line eslint report ast.comments processing configuration,** shebang comment **what eslint-disable-next-line eslint report ast.comments processing configuration js `` safe paste logic type assume version http source,,,,,,,,,,,,

If it cannot, then we should disable scanning; Zenmap can still be used to view existing Nmap XML files, and even to create Nmap command lines.

1329,21407218,Rule Proposal: no-empty-pattern [$10],"Spawned from #3658.

The following code does not raise an syntax error.

``` js
let {a: {}} = foo;
```

But it's considered developer's intent is below.
Because an empty `ObjectPattern` effects nothing.

``` js
let {a = {}} = foo;
```

So this proposal defines new `no-empty-pattern` rule.
This rule considers the following patterns as warnings:

``` js
let {} = foo;
let [] = foo;
let {a: {}} = foo;
let {a: []} = foo;
function foo({}) {}
function foo([]) {}
function foo({a: {}}) {}
function foo({a: []}) {}
```

This rule does not consider the following patterns as warnings:

``` js
let {a = {}} = foo;
let {a = []} = foo;
function foo({a = {}}) {}
function foo({a = []}) {}
```

I'm not sure this rule name is good.

1330,67311348,RPi3B - No visibile client networks,"### Subject of the issue
When I go to 'Configure WiFi Client', the list of networks is empty.

### Your environment
* Raspberry Pi 3 B v1.2
* 2017-11-29 Stretch Lite
* RaspAP Quick Install
* Other software or services running with RaspAP:  SSH

### Steps to reproduce

1. Install the latest stretch lite image onto a raspberry pi 3 B model.
1. Enable and start ssh:  `systemctl enable ssh && systemctl start ssh`
1. Execute the raspap-webgui quick installer:  `wget -q https://git.io/voEUQ -O /tmp/raspap && bash /tmp/raspap`
1. Reboot.
1. Connect to raspap-gui, navigate to 10.3.141.1, then click on 'Configure WiFi Client'.

### Expected behaviour
I would expect to see several networks.  Instead, there are none.

### Actual behaviour
No networks are visibile.

Not sure how this is all supposed to work, but `wpa_cli scan && sleep 3 && wpa_cli scan_results` selects the `p2p-dev-wlan0` device and no results are displayed:

```
root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# wpa_cli scan && sleep 3 && wpa_cli scan_results
Selected interface 'p2p-dev-wlan0'
OK
Selected interface 'p2p-dev-wlan0'
bssid / frequency / signal level / flags / ssid
```

If I manually specify `wlan0`, there are results:

```
root@raspberrypi:/home/pi# wpa_cli -i wlan0 scan && sleep 3 && wpa_cli -i wlan0 scan_results
OK

I've had some trouble importing some geo_shapes in 1.4+, I get the exception:
`ElasticsearchParseException: Invaild shape: Hole is not within polygon`

I got an example. Now, I'm not an expert in GIS, but:
- The area looks like this: http://i.imgur.com/oDzSeDQ.png with one vertex of the hole in the same point as one vertex of the polygon.
- The data is from postgis' ST_AsGeoJSON and according to ST_isValid it's a valid area.
- **Every version of ES from 0.90 to 1.3.x takes the area just fine**. The problems happens after 1.4.0.

1340,25196026,Add an option to override format-time util,"There are many places in the code calling _utilsFormatTimeJs2['default']. Why is this util private? In v4 it was possible to override the time display format. In order to change it now. I have to override the prototype functions of 6 different components instead of just overriding format-time.

This is the override I've came up with:

``` javascript
    videojs.getComponent('PlayProgressBar').prototype.updateDataAttr = function (seconds) {
        var time = this.player_.scrubbing() ? this.player_.getCache().currentTime : this.player_.currentTime();
        this.el_.setAttribute('data-current-time', myCustomTimeFormat(time));
    }
    videojs.getComponent('CurrentTimeDisplay').prototype.updateContent = function updateContent() {
        // Allows for smooth scrubbing, when player can't keep up.
        var time = this.player_.scrubbing() ? this.player_.getCache().currentTime : this.player_.currentTime();
        var localizedText = this.localize('Current Time');
        var formattedTime = myCustomTimeFormat(time);
        this.contentEl_.innerHTML = '<span class=""vjs-control-text"">' + localizedText + '</span> ' + formattedTime;
    };
    videojs.getComponent('DurationDisplay').prototype.updateContent = function updateContent() {
        var duration = this.player_.duration();
        if (duration) {
            var localizedText = this.localize('Duration Time');
            var formattedTime = myCustomTimeFormat(duration);
            this.contentEl_.innerHTML = '<span class=""vjs-control-text"">' + localizedText + '</span> ' + formattedTime; // label the duration time for screen reader users
        }
    };
    videojs.getComponent('RemainingTimeDisplay').prototype.updateContent = function updateContent() {
        if (this.player_.duration()) {
            var localizedText = this.localize('Remaining Time');
            var formattedTime = myCustomTimeFormat(this.player_.remainingTime());
            this.contentEl_.innerHTML = '<span class=""vjs-control-text"">' + localizedText + '</span> -' + formattedTime;
        }
    };
    videojs.getComponent('MouseTimeDisplay').prototype.update = function update(newTime, position) {
        var time = myCustomTimeFormat(newTime);
        this.el().style.left = position + 'px';
        this.el().setAttribute('data-current-time', time);
    };
    videojs.getComponent('SeekBar').prototype.updateARIAAttributes = function updateARIAAttributes() {
        // Allows for smooth scrubbing, when player can't keep up.
        var time = this.player_.scrubbing() ? this.player_.getCache().currentTime : this.player_.currentTime();
        this.el_.setAttribute('aria-valuenow', (this.getPercent() * 100).toFixed(2)); // machine readable value of progress bar (percentage complete)
        this.el_.setAttribute('aria-valuetext', myCustomTimeFormat(time)); // human readable value of progress bar (time complete)
    };
```

myCustomTimeFormat - formats time value with frames segment.

1342,34798175,don't bubble `componentchanged` event,"**Description:**

`Entity.emit` third argument is a boolean for whether to bubble. Flip that to false for `componentchanged`.

@blairmacintyre:

``````

>Based on the documentation and example in entity.md, I set up a componentchanged listener on an entity that looks for changes to it's rotation component.  BUT, I have an animated entity in the entity graph below this node with an animation component on it.  Component.js does not set ""bubbles"" to false, so the events are bubbling up!  So, I was happily rotating whenever the child rotated (which was always).  Arg. (edited)

[5:54]  
I added
```      if (evt.target != this.el) { return; }```
to the start of my event handler.

[5:55]  
Which dealt with it.  But the question is:  should component changed events have the bubbles set to false (should the be bubbling??) or should the examples start including this test?

blairmacintyre [6:01 AM]  
It's understandable why bubbling is good by default:  I could set up one handler at the top of a subgraph, and handle things by explicitly looking at the target element.  BUT, the examples in the documentation should start doing this, even in the simple examples, so people have that in their minds when they write components or eventListeners.  :disappointed:

1356,53434662,Methods are added to Linter in a suboptimal way,"In `lib/linter.js`, there are a few methods [here](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/blob/3d020b9083de105ce8adc67bc3efae0aac01e03f/lib/linter.js#L1263-L1298) that need to be copied onto `Linter.prototype`. The current implementation works, but it's not ideal, for a few reasons:

A little something that might have to do with pointer event handing for IE11. Try any map with a zoom component in IE11 like http://leafletjs.com/. Click the zoom buttons, they will keep the ""leaflet-active"" class, even after you pushed them.

This class should be removed when up.

This might have to do with this issue #2102 because the ""_onUp"" function is never called.

In Pointer.js, I believe there is an issue. in the function addPointerListenerEnd:
this._pointers is undefined so no touch id is sent to the event

It might lead to bigger issues, although i didn't experience any other bad effect

Notice in the console, that the log inside the callback is logging that `e.target === null` evaluates to `true`. In my app, I'm passing the `event` to an `onChange` handler which utilizes the `target`. So this update breaks that situation.

Hi!

I encountered the following problem when using **fs.watchFile**. I start watching a file, let's say _file1_, the file is renamed into _file2_ and then back into _file1_. 

On the first rename, my listener is called with currentStat filled with 0s (correct, as the file does not exist) and some values for the previousStat. 

On the second rename, when the file gets the name it had initially, the previousStat is the same one as the previousStat of the first rename (I think it should be the one filled with 0s, as the file did not exist previously) and has the same modified time as the currentStat. This way, I cannot determine that the file has reappeared. 

I am comparing that the modified time has changed in order to avoid false alarms triggered by file access as specified in the Node.js documentation.",1,file previousstat rename fill modified currentstat _file1_ issue node.js exist,file previousstat rename fill modified currentstat _file1_ issue node.js exist core v8.4.0 v6.11.2 reappear initially centos _file2_ **fs.watchfile** output tracker,,,,,,,,,,,,

1390,28213746,PropertyAccessDecorator should not accept callable strings,"Right now, PropertyAccessDecorator [treats callable strings as callables, not as strings](https://github.com/symfony/symfony/blob/master/src/Symfony/Component/Form/ChoiceList/Factory/PropertyAccessDecorator.php#L87). Consequently the following code does not behave as expected:

``` php
$builder->add('deadline', ChoiceType::class, [
    'choices' => $dateRanges, // DateRange objects
    'choice_label' => 'end',
]);
```

This code results in a fatal error. The `end()` function exists (is callable), hence the string is not treated as property path. Instead, `end()` is called with invalid arguments. IMO there are very few cases where this would be the expected behavior, and even if, it could be solved by passing a closure:

``` php
$builder->add('deadline', ChoiceType::class, [
    'choices' => $dateRanges, // arrays of dates
    'choice_label' => function (array $dateRange) {
        return end($dateRange);

]);
```

Treating callable strings as callables should be deprecated. I.e., all methods of PropertyAccessDecorator should trigger deprecation errors `if (is_string($value) && is_callable($value))`.

Secondly, since no other mail client does this, it makes it look like the mutt user manually typed in that subject. The wording of `Re: your mail` looks obnoxious to me, and IMO feels like the user is criticising the original mail for having no subject.

Finally, the text is hard-coded, and hence not localised. Users in other languages are forced to use this string.

I found a (trivial) [patch](https://github.com/williamsmj/mutt-empty-subject-patch/blob/master/mutt-empty-subject.patch) to fix this, and use the ""correct"" subject of `Re: ` instead.

1406,47136,[storage|aws] File#get should not rescue NotFound for no such bucket,"Hi,

Look at this
https://github.com/geemus/fog/blob/master/lib/fog/storage/models/aws/files.rb#L50-52

I think get() should not rescue Excon::Errors::NotFound.
The rescue has to be done on a higher level. For AWS you can get a NotFound error code for different reasons. NoSuchKey or NoSuchBucket.
Because it's been rescued I can't have access to the exception and parse the response body.

For now I use put_object method to do it

Currently you have to go back to Visual mode to set a breakpoint, and then back to Visual Panels mode.

1410,58760990,emails: Send followup_day2 email two days later.,"This piece of code in zerver/lib/notifications.py stages a particular email to be sent one day after a new user signs up. 
```
    send_future_email(
        ""zerver/emails/followup_day2"", to_user_id=user.id, from_name=from_name,
        from_address=from_address, context=context, delay=datetime.timedelta(days=1))
```

It'd be great to replace the delay so that the email is sent 
* 2 days from now instead of 1 day
* If that results in it being a weekend in the user's timezone (we have timezone info in `UserProfile.timezone`), round up to Monday
* Subtract 1 hour. The reasoning being that we want to maximize the chance that the user gets the email at the beginning of the time when they're usually dealing with stuff.

I'd do this by adding a function called `followup_email_delay(user)` above `enqueue_welcome_emails`. 

The function should have good tests. I'd add a test for 
* the vanilla case, where the signup is on a Tuesday
* the weekend case, where the signup is Thursday UTC
* a case where it is Thursday UTC but Wednesday in the user's timezone

As discussed on [the mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!searchin/gensim/fat$20warning%7Csort:relevance/gensim/0GVxA055yOU/5m2jwfdBBAAJ)

```
Perhaps `train()` should require an explicit (non-default) `passes` parameter. In the 1-liner/initialization-trains case, it'd be called with the 'iter' value. For anyone calling it themselves, they'd have to make an explicit choice of 'passes'. And after the change, any old code without the parameter would (by design) break, forcing a change to explicit specification. 

Perhaps even `alpha` and `min_alpha` should be explicit required parameters to `train()`, to ensure those calling it directly aren't see-sawing the values each call. Calling 'train()' directly is kind of an advanced approach, so requiring this level of choice may be appropriate.

* [x] Can you reproduce the problem with `Debug -> Reload Without Extensions`?
* [x] Did you perform a cursory search to see if your bug or enhancement is already reported?
* [x] Did you read the [Troubleshooting guide](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/Troubleshooting)?

For more information on how to write a good bug report read [here](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/wiki/How-to-Report-an-Issue)
For more information on how to contribute read [here](https://github.com/adobe/brackets/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

### Description

When you get a preference object it is does not extends the defaults values but it overwrite them.

### Steps to Reproduce

1. Define a preference object
like `closeTags` in `editor/Editor.js`
2. Set your preference using `Debug / Open Preferences File`
something like `""closeTags"": { ""whenOpening"": false }`
3. Retrieve it
using PreferencesManager.get

If `closeTags` is defined like this:
```js
""closeTags"": {
    ""dontCloseTags"": [],
    ""indentTags"": [],
    ""whenClosing"": true,
    ""whenOpening"": true
}
```

**Expected behavior:** 
The object retrieved should be
```js
""closeTags"": {
    ""dontCloseTags"": [],
    ""indentTags"": [],
    ""whenClosing"": true,
    ""whenOpening"": false
}
```

**Actual behavior:**
```js
""closeTags"": {
    ""whenOpening"": false
}
```

Is this the correct behaviour? It was totally unexpected to me.
