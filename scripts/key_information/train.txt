This error might occur in other sklearn_api classes, too.\n\nI believe that either the default value of Sparse2Corpus constructor\'s `documents_columns` parameter should be changed:\n\n```python\nclass Sparse2Corpus(object):\n    """\n    Convert a matrix in scipy.sparse format into a streaming gensim corpus.\n    This is the mirror function to `corpus2csc`.\n    """\n\n    # Change this to def __init__(self, sparse, documents_columns=False) ?\n    def __init__(self, sparse, documents_columns=True):\n        if documents_columns:\n            self.sparse = sparse.tocsc()\n        else:\n            self.sparse = sparse.tocsr().T  # make sure shape[1]=number of docs (needed in len())\n```\n\nor the following call should include that `documents_columns=False`:\n\n```python\n# Same happens in lda model\nclass HdpTransformer(TransformerMixin, BaseEstimator):\n    ...\n    def fit(self, X, y=None):\n        """\n        Fit the model according to the given training data.\n        Calls gensim.models.HdpModel\n        """\n        if sparse.issparse(X):\n            corpus = matutils.Sparse2Corpus(X) # Change to matutils.Sparse2Corpus(X, False) ?\n        ...\n```\n\n\n<!-- Example: Vocabulary size is not what I expected when training Word2Vec. -->\n\n#### Steps/Code/Corpus to Reproduce\n\nExample: The number of processed documents corresponds to the number of features.\n\n```python\nfrom sklearn.datasets import fetch_20newsgroups\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer\nfrom gensim.sklearn_api.hdp import HdpTransformer\n\n# Small dataset configuration\nngs = fetch_20newsgroups()\nsamples = ngs.data[:100]\n\n# Simple count vectorization\nvectorizer = CountVectorizer()\n# x is a sparse matrix\nx = vectorizer.fit_transform(samples)\nprint("%d documents, %d features" % x.shape) # 100 documents, 6547 features\n\ninv_vocab = {v: k for k, v in vectorizer.vocabulary_.items()}\n\n# Train a HDP\nhdp_transformer = HdpTransformer(inv_vocab)\nhdp_transformer.fit(x)\n\n# Should be 100 but got 6547\nprint("Processed documents %d" % hdp_transformer.gensim_model.m_num_docs_processed) # 6547\n```\n\n#### Expected Results\nWe should expect that the hdp gensim model had processed the 100 documents in samples.\n```python\nprint("%d documents, %d features" % x.shape)\n# 100 documents, 6547 features\n```\n\n#### Actual Results\nHDP processed 6547 documents\n```python\nprint("Processed documents: %d" % hdp_transformer.gensim_model.m_num_docs_processed)\n# Processed documents: 6547\n```\n\n#### Workaround, for the record\nTo make it work correctly, the sparse matrix `x` should be transposed.\n```python\nvectorizer = CountVectorizer()\nx = vectorizer.fit_transform(samples)\ninv_vocab = {v: k for k, v in vectorizer.vocabulary_.items()}\n\nhdp_transformer = HdpTransformer(inv_vocab)\nhdp_transformer.fit(x.T)\n```\n\n#### Versions\n```\nWindows-8.1-6.3.9600\n(\'Python\', \'2.7.13 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Dec 19 2016, 13:29:36) [MSC v.1500 64 bit (AMD64)]\')\n(\'NumPy\', \'1.12.1\')\n(\'SciPy\', \'1.0.0\')\n(\'gensim\', \'3.0.1\')\n(\'FAST_VERSION\', 0)\n```\n\n', '0']

According to [the docs](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/5e20b7bcfbefa9084ab6cdac9c24926ba8a64126/docs/NativeModulesIOS.md#optimizing-for-zero-listeners), the `startObserving` method won\'t be called until somebody subscribes to `NotificationManagerIOS`.\n\nThis means there is a scenario when the developer can call `requestPermissions` without subscribing to notifications first, but since `RCTPushNotificationManager` relies on `NSNotificationCenter` subscribtion, the result will never be returned.\n\nThis should be fairly straightforward to solve for somebody new to React Native. Feel free to send a PR!\n\n### Reproduction\n\nHave this in your JS file\n\n```javascript\nPushNotificationIOS.requestPermissions().then(console.log);\n```\n\nYou\'ll see iOS permissions dialog, however pressing "Allow" won\'t resolve the promise and nothing will be printed to the console.\n\n### Solution\n\nChange the code to this, then uninstall and run the app again (needed to reset iOS permissions cache):\n\n```javascript\nPushNotificationIOS.addEventListener(\'localNotification\', () => {});\nPushNotificationIOS.requestPermissions().then(console.log);\n```\n\nNow "Allow" button will work as expected, the promise will be resolved and you\'ll see log entry.\n\n### Additional Information\n\n* React Native version: 0.42.0\n* Platform: iOS\n* Operating System: macOS\n', '1']

The [documentation](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/tags-and-attributes.html#html-attributes) for HTML attributes could omit `icon` too.\n\nI encountered this issue when working with TypeScript, and I opened an issue about the React type definition at https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/issues/10467. Because React itself includes `icon`, custom interfaces which extend [DefinitelyTyped’s `React.HTMLAttributes`](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/613673de3672114c562fdf9f142bfeefc29173c9/react/react.d.ts#L1968) cannot include a non-string `icon` property.\n\n**Which versions of React, and which browser / OS are affected by this issue?

However, `ast.comments` now includes shebang comments (they have type `Shebang`), so this is no longer a safe assumption.\n\nThere are a few different ways that this could be fixed:\n\n* Filter out shebangs before doing any processing on them.\n* Make the logic explicitly check that a comment has type `Line` before assuming that it\'s a line comment.', '0']

In the 1-liner/initialization-trains case, it'd be called with the 'iter' value. For anyone calling it themselves, they'd have to make an explicit choice of 'passes'. And after the change, any old code without the parameter would (by design) break, forcing a change to explicit specification. \n\nPerhaps even `alpha` and `min_alpha` should be explicit required parameters to `train()`, to ensure those calling it directly aren't see-sawing the values each call. Calling 'train()' directly is kind of an advanced approach, so requiring this level of choice may be appropriate. \n\n```", '0']
